        <p class="bio">Fisrt the question is that why I added the portion about Imam Jaffar Sadiq to my website and the answer is because He holds a special place in my heart. He is not only my Imam but also my teacher, and I take great pride in being his devoted follower as a member of the Fiqah-e-Jaffariya. <br><br>



            I feel blessed that I can contribute to the spread of his knowledge. To achieve this, I have created a series on my Instagram page, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tabbara_and_tawalla/" >tabbara_and_tawalla</a> where I explore captivating topics related to the imam's scientific wisdom.
            <br><br>

            While my aspirations include creating <span> a separate website for my page </span>  in the future, for now, I have consolidated these treasures within this platform. It is a reflection of the feedback I received, urging me to share more about Imam Jaffar Sadiq and his enlightening books. <br><br>

            I genuinely pray that my efforts find acceptance from Allah (swt) and my beloved Maula (a), and that they become a channel to magnify the profound teachings of Imam Jaffar Sadiq. Remember in your prayers! Ali Waris (a)!!!<i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i> </p>

        <h1 class="sub-title">Imam Jaffar al-Sadiq (a.s):</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="bio">
            <span>Imam Jaffar al-Sadiq </span>, also known as Ja'far ibn Muhammad al-Sadiq, was a prominent figure in Islamic history. He was born in 702 CE in Medina, which is located in present-day Saudi Arabia. Imam al-Sadiq is considered the sixth Imam by the Twelver Shia branch of Islam, who believe in the twelve divine leaders known as Imams.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>Imam Jaffar al-Sadiq</span> played a significant role in the development of Islamic jurisprudence, theology, and Islamic sciences. He was known for his deep knowledge and teachings in various fields, including Islamic law (fiqh), theology (kalam), philosophy, ethics, and other subjects. Many students and scholars sought knowledge from him, and he is credited with educating numerous scholars who later became influential figures in Islamic scholarship.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>Imam al-Sadiq's teachings and intellectual contributions</span> had a lasting impact on Islamic thought and the development of Shia Islam. He emphasized the importance of reason and rationality in understanding religious principles and encouraged his followers to seek knowledge and understanding. His approach to religious teachings and his emphasis on intellectual pursuits contributed to the rich intellectual tradition within Shia Islam.
            
            Imam Jaffar al-Sadiq passed away in 765 CE in Medina, and he is buried in the famous Jannat al-Baqi cemetery in Medina. His legacy as a scholar and an influential figure in Shia Islam continues to be revered by Shia Muslims, and his teachings remain a source of inspiration for many.
            <br>
            <br>

            To gain a deeper understanding of Imam Jaffar al-Sadiq, I recommend exploring the book <span>"The Superman in Islam: Imam Jaffar"</span> or <span>"Maghaze Mutafakir Jehan Shia"</span> (Arabic book). Within its pages, you will discover the teachings of Imam al-Sadiq aligned with contemporary scientific knowledge. This invaluable resource delves into the wisdom imparted by the Imam, bridging the gap between his teachings and the advancements of our time. By delving into this book, you can expand your knowledge of Imam Jaffar al-Sadiq and his teachings in light of present-day science.

        <h1 class="sub-title books"> A <span>Book</span> on Imam Jaffar al-Sadiq (a.s):</h1> <br>
        <p>Imam Jaffar-e-Sadiq was a significant figure in Islamic history, widely recognized as a highly respected scholar and teacher. The book titled "Imam Jaffar-e-Sadiq: The Superman in Islam" appears to be a biography that delves into the life and teachings of Imam Jaffar-e-Sadiq.

            In general, the book seems to be a valuable and enlightening resource for those interested in expanding their knowledge about Imam Jaffar-e-Sadiq's life and teachings. It may provide valuable insights into the religious and cultural contexts of Islamic history, shedding light on the remarkable contributions of influential figures like Imam Jaffar-e-Sadiq to the development of Islam.
            
            While some individuals may express doubts or harbor negative opinions about this book, I personally do not share the same perspective. I believe that Imam Jaffar-e-Sadiq possessed knowledge not only in science but in various other fields as well.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There is a review of Zabih Allah Mansuri (Farsi Murtajim Az France) which states:</p>
            <br> 
            <p class="box">"I am a Shia follower and a Muslim, but I never knew why the Shia sect is referred to as 'Jaffery.' I had no knowledge about Imam Jaffar (AS) and what he said about his own life and the actions he undertook. Are we not the followers of Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib? Isn't it appropriate to give the Shia sect the title of 'Hussaini' considering the sacrifice and devotion of Imam Hussain (a)? I found answers to all these questions when I came across a magazine from the Islamic Studies Centre, The Superman in Islam that discussed about the knowledge of Imam Jaffar. Reading this pamphlet enlightened me about why Imam Jaffar holds such a distinguished position among the Imams and why the Shia sect is associated with his name."</p>
            <br> <br>
            <h1 class="sub-title">Download the book:</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p class="bio">
                <span > Now the question arises: </span> Where can I find or buy this book for reading? <br> There are three versions of the book available: one in English, one in Urdu, and another in Persian/Arabic. However, locating the English translated version can be quite challenging. Despite some websites claiming to provide the English version, I have discovered that these sites are experiencing technical issues. Nevertheless, you can still attempt to search for it in English using the book's title, "The Mastermind of the Shiite World." If you happen to come across it, please inform me as well.
<br><br>
                If you're interested in obtaining the Persian/Arabic version of the book, search for its title "Maghaz-e-Mutafakir" instead of "Superman in Islam." This search will lead you to several websites offering the PDF version of the book. One reputable website I found is <a href=https://s1.picofile.com/file/8261718668/%D9%85%D8%BA%D8%B2_%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%81%DA%A9%D8%B1_%D8%B4%DB%8C%D8%B9%D9%87.pdf.html" >ClickHere-Maghaz-e-Mutafakir Jehan Shia </a> Simply visit this page and download it. I would provide it to you on my page, but I'm unable to do so due to privacy and copyright concerns.
                <br> <br>
                Now, if you're looking for the book in Urdu and want to purchase it online, the place from where I ordered it is currently out of stock. I also checked various other websites, but it's unavailable there as well. However, don't lose hope because there is still one website where the book is available. You can find it at <a href="https://haadionlinestore.com/shop/superman-in-islam/" >Click here for store. </a>. I recommend checking the reviews and verifying the dealer's authenticity before placing an order.
                <br><br>
                If you prefer the Urdu version in PDF format, you can visit this website:  <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/126754643/Superman-in-Islam-Imam-Jafar-Sadiq-A-S" >Click here for PDf </a>. and download it from there. </p>
